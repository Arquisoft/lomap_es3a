== Architecture Constraints 

=== Table 1. Technical Constraints 

[options="header",cols="2,7"] 
|=== 
| Constraint | Explanation 

| *_SOLID_*
| With SOLID we can allow people to store their data securely in decentralized data stores called Pods that are like secure personal web servers for data. This way, they can allow or reject the application to access the data or not. 

| *_Docker_*
| The application will be running in a Docker Host 

| *_GitHub_*
| We will use github to have a remote repository to develop the project, create and assign different tasks to team members, and perform version control. Github allows us communicating and organizing the project 
|=== 
 
=== Table 2. Organizational Constraints 
 
[options="header",cols="2,7"] 
|=== 
| Constraint | Explanation 
 
| *_Size of the team_*  
| The team is made of four people. At the beginning we were a group of five people but one of the members was move out of the group, because the groups were restructured. 
 
| *_Testing_* 
| Different scenarios will be considered to test a correct behavior of the app. Some different techniques will be used to test the application with the higher-the-better coverage. 
 
| *_Meetings_* 
| We will discuss the organization of the to-do tasks in a meeting at each laboratory class. In case we need to arrange an extraordinary meeting, for this, we have created a specific Discord channel, divided in chats _(general, resources, tasks)_, so we can communicate easier, and also have voice meetings.. 

| *_GitHub Discussions_*
| We are the first team using discussions, so we can leave a register of our conversations and thoughts about the project and the development of it.
 
| *_Experience_*  
| Team members have low experience when working with the diverse technologies we are using. However, it is the first time we are creating a _real life_ project but we learnt a lot of the technologies used in this project. 
 
| *_Working as a team_* 
| It is the second time we have worked together making a big project, making this experience easier than we thought. 
 
| *_Coordination_* 
| A good coordination must be carried out by each component of the group to accomplish all the objectives proposed.

=== Table 3. Conventions 
 
[options="header",cols="2,7"] 
|=== 
| Constraint | Explanation 
 
| *_Language_*
| Any person must be able to interact with the application and successfully complete any task in it, for example, they should be able to search for certain locations near them and interact with other users as well. 
 
| *_Clean Code_*
|The code conforming the application must be well written and clean, so it is easier to understand and work with (_maintainability_ in mind). 
 
| *_Documentation_*
| The documentation must be created by following the https://arc42.org/[Arc42] method, so it is clear, simple and effective.
 
| *_Accessibility_*
| The application must be easy to navigate through any user, so anyone interested in it can do it easily. Regardless of any disability. 
 
| *_Programming Language conventions_*
| We should follow the conventions of the programming languages we are using. Some of those are the https://jsdoc.app/[_JavaScript_] conventions. 
 
| *_SOLID_*
|The application must follow the https://github.com/solid/solid-spec[_Solid_] specifications.
