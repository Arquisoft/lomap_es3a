=== Quality Scenarios

==== Introduction

In order to make quality requirements more concrete and measurable, it is important to describe them using quality scenarios. Quality scenarios describe the expected behavior of the system when a specific stimulus is received. In the case of a service which is a map where users can mark locations and share information with friends, there are two important types of scenarios for architects to consider.

==== Usage Scenarios

Usage scenarios, also known as application or use case scenarios, describe how the system should react at runtime in response to a particular stimulus. These scenarios can also include descriptions of the system's efficiency or performance. An example of a usage scenario for the map service is:


===== Privacy

|===
| *_Scenario_* | *_Stimulus_* | *_Response_*
 
| The user will log in to our application and will enter personal information such as the places they have visited, comments about those places, personal photos they have taken....

| The user adds information to our application wants it to be safe and secure from other people to see. In other words, the user only wants him to be able to access that information and her friends in the event that he gives them reading permissions.

| Our application will save all the bookmarks that the user adds along with all the comments and photos that they include, in the lomap folder of their pod. Only the user and his friends have access to this folder if he gives them read permissions.
|===

===== Usability

|===
| *_Scenario_* | *_Stimulus_* | *_Response_*
 
| A new user who has never used our application starts using it and due to the usability aids that we have introduced, they know how to use it and it is easy for them to navigate the app.

| The user wants to use our app to generate maps with the places they have visited and since it is usable they can navigate through the app without problem and share their bookmarks.

| The application is designed with usability in mind with easily understandable designs and notifications every time the user performs an action.
|===

==== Change Scenarios

Change scenarios describe modifications to the system or its environment that could impact its quality attributes. For example, if additional functionality is implemented or there is a change in quality requirements, the system may need to be modified. An example of a change scenario for the map service is:

===== Maintainability

|===
| *_Scenario_* | *_Stimulus_* | *_Response_*

| You want to introduce new functionalities in the application or modify some that we already have implemented.

| Users ask us to introduce a functionality that allows you to create routes.

| As we have maintainable code, we will have to add little code to modify the view of the maps reusing components that we have already created.
|===

===== Scalability

|===
| *_Scenario_* | *_Stimulus_* | *_Response_*
 
| While the app is being used by users, something needs to be changed/upgraded.

| The system is correctly designed, so its easier to add that modification.

| The modification is implemented fast without problems, the users can now see that change and there hasn't been any difficulties.
|===

===== Testability

|===
| *_Scenario_* | *_Stimulus_* | *_Response_*
 
| The application has a functionality that does not work correctly. For example, the markers are not filtered well when searching for them by category.

| The users of the application report a bug that they are finding when filtering the markers by category because there are times when markers of a non-selected category are shown.

| As we have developed tests for all the functionalities, we would have to create tests that would check exactly that functionality to detect the failure and fix it. Due to the previously implemented tests, it would not be difficult to generate this new test and the problem would be solved quickly.
