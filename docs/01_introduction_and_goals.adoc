== Introduction and Goals 

GOMap!® is a project developed for the University of Oviedo's Software Architecture course, based on the base project LoMap, it has been ordered by *_HappySw_*, a software development company who was hired by the Council of Brussels, so the citizens are able to use it. This version will be developed by es3a team, formed by: 

* Carlos Díez Fernández, mailto:UO284373@uniovi.es[_UO284373_].

* Raúl Fernández España, mailto:UO278036@uniovi.es[_UO278036_].

* Omar Teixeira González, mailto:UO281847@uniovi.es[_UO281847_].

* David Leszek Warzynski Abril, mailto:UO28968@uniovi.es[_UO278968_].

GOMap!® is a software system where users can have custom maps about places and local businesses, and also provides more functionalities, which are:

* Add locations and show them in a map.

* Add reviews, scores, comments, pictures, etc...

* Search filters like by category, friends,etc...

* Show information about the places of your friends. 

* Share favorites places with your friends.  
 
=== Requirements Overview  

* Users will be able to do lots of things through this app, from adding locations in different categories, such as shops, restaurants, monuments, etc... To show locations in a map window or add review scores, comments or pictures about those locations. 

* If it is considered necessary, the system could store other information in a centralized way for performance reasons, trying to respect the privacy of the users as much as possible. 

* The system will also allow users to see places and information about those places taken from their friends, and see the map through various filters, such as category, friends, etc... 

It is also possible to obtain more information through the following https://arquisoft.github.io/course2223/labAssignmentDescription.html[link], which contains a more specific description about the app itself. 
 
=== Quality Goals

|=== 
| Priority | Quality Goal | Motivation

| *1*
| *_Privacy_*
| The system must keep the privacy of the user. Following the characteristics of the SOLID project, all user information will be stored in him/her POD, so it won't have any vulnerability caused by having data stored in a database.

| *2*
| *_Usability_*
| The application must be intuitive and easy to use for the client, so that any user will be able to use it regardless of their knowledge.  

| *3*
| *_Maintainability_*
| The architecture of the application must allow adding new functionalities or modifying the existing ones making as few changes as possible. 

| *4*
| *_Scalability_*
| The application must be adaptable and responsive with respect to performance as the number of users of the application increases.

| *5*
| *_Testability_*
| Unit tests will be applied to the application to ensure the proper performance of the system.
