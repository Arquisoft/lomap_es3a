== Introduction and Goals 

GOMap!® is a project developed for the Software Architecture course of the University of Oviedo, based on the base project LoMap. This version will be developed by the team es3a, formed by: 

* Carlos Díez Fernández, _UO284373_

* Raúl Fernández España, _UO278036_

* Omar Teixeira González, _UO281847

* David Leszek Warzynski Abril, _UO278968_ 
 
GOMap!® is a software system where users can have custom maps about places and local businesses in their city. 

The app provides users with the possibility of: 

* Add locations and show them in a map 

* Add reviews, scores, comments, pictures, etc. 

* Search filters like by category, friends,etc. 

* Show information about the places of your friends. 

* Share favorites places with your friends.  
 
=== Requirements Overview  

* Users will be able to do lots of things through this app, from adding locations in different categories, such as shops, restaurants, monuments, etc... To show locations in a map window or add review scores, comments or pictures about those locations. 

* It will be possible to manage from the application the information that is accessible with other users, like their friends or groups of friends. This information should not be centralized and should be stored in each user’s pod.  

* If it is considered necessary, the system could store other information in a centralized way for performance reasons, trying to respect the privacy of the users as much as possible. 

* The system will also allow users to see places and information about those places taken from their friends, and see the map through various filters, such as category, friends, etc... 

It is also possible to obtain more information through the following link, which contains a more specific description about the app itself. 
 
=== Quality Goals

|=== 
|Priority |Quality Goal|Motivation 

|1| Privacy 
| The system must keep the privacy of the user. Following the characteristics of the SOLID project, the information stored in the database and displayed will always be authorized by the client. In the case of having to store information centrally, it will be done ensuring the user's privacy. 

|2| Usability 
| The application must be intuitive and easy to use for the client, so that any user will be able to use it regardless of their knowledge.  

|3| Maintainability
| The architecture of the application must allow adding new functionalities or modifying the existing ones making as few changes as possible. 

|4| Performance 
| The application must assure maximum speed responding to user interactions, minimizing loading times. 

|5| Testability 
| Unit tests will be applied to the application to ensure the proper performance of the system.
