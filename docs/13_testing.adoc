== Testing

=== Unitary testing (TDD)

We used _Jest_ and _Testing Library_ by React for testing our webapp, we followed the structure that we learned in our labs and https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started[Jest docs]. 

We created separate tests for each component, in order to test isolated parts and check if every aspect of our app worked, but we faced some problems in the process, as it ended up being almost impossible to check everything, mostly due to compatibility issues with libraries and problems with the react testing library itself (which is not suited to test the useState hook).

We reached a total coverage of 72.1% (at the momment of writing this document) with 106 tests in 25 suites, we had to mock the session and functions that interact with the PODs, but sometimes it wasn't enought, due to the reasons we commented before.

=== Integration testing (BDD)

We used Jest and Cucumber to perform integration testing in our app. Following cucumber gherkin language, we designed tests and User Stories with the structure: "Given, When, Then", which resulted in a lot of facilities when implementing them.

As GOMap! uses external technology, such as a Session Provider (Inrupt, SOLID Community, ...) or SOLID PODs, we had to test with some default values, written to test if this external techs worked propperly in our app context.

In the end we manage to have 2 e2e features, with 4 general tests:

====

Feature: Access the app

  Scenario: First time a new user enters the app
    Given User has never entered to the app
    When User sees all main page elements
    Then User can interact with the app

====

====

Feature: Login to an account

  Scenario: Displays login button when user is not logged in
    Given User is not logged in
    When User opens up the page
    Then User can see the login button

  Scenario: User goes to login page and can access to its selected provider login form
    Given User is not logged in
    When User opens up login page
    Then User is able to select a provider and be redirected to the login form

  Scenario: User logs into the app
    Given User is not logged in
    When User access to provider's login form
    Then User is logged in

=== Load testing

Load testing is a process of testing the performance of a system by simulating a large number of users accessing the system. This tests are important to ensure the performance quality goal defined previously. In our case, to perform this test we used Gatling tool. This tool allows to record an action in the website and later simulate this actions but with a large number of users. Finally, we can see the results of the test and the average time of all the requests and a more complete report of the test.

In our case, we managed to achieve a load test of the app with a 3 users per second and a total duration of 15 seconds. The results obtained reflect that the average time of the requests was above 1200 ms. This is because our application makes multiple calls to the PODs, so the response time is less. The complete results can be seen in the following image in which we can see how 572 requests have been made, of which 65 took less than 800 ms, 46 took between 800 and 1200 ms, 396 took more than 1200 ms and 65 failed due to reasons of the connection with the PODs which is foreign to us.
