## ðŸ˜€ Usability tests

### ðŸ“– Tasks description
To carry out the usability tests, the user will have to perform three medium-sized tasks so that the developers can check the performance of the app with users of all kinds.

The tasks are:

1. The user must change the language to their own, access the project documentation, and return to the home page. Subsequently, they must log in, being able to select a provider (or leave the default one), and access the login panel of the chosen provider. Once there, the user must enter the following data:
    * User: lomapes3aUser
    * Password: @lomapes3a_Passwd

    Once this is done, the user will be redirected to the map window, where they must create a new map (with the name they choose) and try to add a marker, with the data they want, but they must add a photo. Once this is done, the user must see the marker they have added.

2. The user starts from the previous point, currently, the user will have 3 friends already added (formed by the group members). They must be able to access one of the shared maps of one of those friends (whichever they want) and subsequently try to apply various filters to it so that they can check that the selected categories correspond to the displayed markers. After this, the user must go to their personal profile and change the username to their own. Subsequently, they must access the friends panel and add a fourth friend, with the username: "omitg".

3. The user must access the About panel and access the GitHub profile of any of the 4 developers. Subsequently, they will go through the help window, where they must enter their name, email address: uo281847@uniovi.es, and any message, and then send it. To finish, the user will return to the map and try to create a new map, again with the name they want, and try to switch between this and the previous one. In the first map, where they had created a marker in the first task, the user must add a review, with the rating and comment they prefer.

Once this is done, the user will have completed the 3 tasks and the test will have ended.
